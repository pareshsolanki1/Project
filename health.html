                7.5 lakhs mothers and newborns were reached through 81 government health facilities since the inception
                of the programme in 2015. During April 2018 to June 2021, 433,100 cases were registered and 165,000
                (38%) high-risk cases were detected through the ASMAN app.

                Reliance Foundation implemented a health system quality improvement programme in Warangal district,
                Telangana for three years (January 2016 to December 2018). Technical support was provided to a few
                primary and secondary health facilities, and Mahatma Gandhi Medical Hospital at the tertiary level. At
                the tertiary care level, the intervention was focussed on raising standards of healthcare delivery
                through process standardization using NABH guidelines, capacity building of senior staff through
                techno-managerial trainings and facilitate promotion of electronic hospital information management
                system for registration of outpatients and management of inpatient records. On the other hand, at
                primary and secondary care level, support was provided for strengthening the facilities to implement
                protocols/standards and to improve the quality of healthcare during intrapartum and postpartum period
                for the mothers and the new-born by providing trainings to the staff nurses and doctors. At the tertiary
                level, through series of trainings and process documentation, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital increased
                their score from 1.47 to 7.38 using NABH methodology. In addition, the efforts of Reliance Foundation
                resulted in accessing additional resources from government to enhance the health quality systems. In
                primary and secondary health facilities, training on PHC management and MNH skills, has vastly improved
                the health services in these facilities. The assessments carried out by the programme saw significant
                improvement in facility and maternal & neonatal standards from 9% to 53% at the end of the project
                whereas the standards of Maternal and Neonatal Health improved from 15% to 75%.

                To help meet the sudden demand for specialised healthcare facilities during COVID-19, Reliance
                Foundation set up medical, quarantine and intensive care facilities, providing for over 2,000 COVID-19
                hospital beds across different locations in India.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reliance Foundation demonstrated its commitment and capacity to rise up to the situation during the
                response to the COVID-19 crisis setting up the first, COVID-19 dedicated hospital in India in just two
                weeks in March 2020, in collaboration with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporate (BMC).

                and quarantine services for patients form the safety of their home.
            </p>
            <p>
                In response to the second wave, Reliance Foundation scaled up its support. This included a dedicated
                COVID-19 care facility at the National Sports Club of India, Worli, Mumbai, managed by the Sir H.N.
                Reliance Foundation Hospital, and Gujarat’s first paediatric COVID-19 hospital at Jamnagar. All
                facilities were set up in record time keeping the urgency of the prevailing situation in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reliance Foundation’s Mobile Medical Units continued to provide medical assistance to the rural
                communities in the times of COVID-19 and also helped raise awareness about precautionary measures like
                social distancing, wearing masks and hand washing in surrounding villages.

                To ensure uninterrupted emergency services, Reliance Foundation provided free fuel to government
                notified vehicles and ambulances to ease the transportation of COVID-19 patients. Reliance Foundation
                provided over 27 lakh litres (2.7 million litres) of free fuel, supporting 70,000+ ambulances across 21
                states and 3 Union Territories. The mission to distribute free fuel for ambulances across 21 states was
                taken up between May and September 2021 during the second COVID wave, providing a much needed boost to
                emergency response services.

                masks to police personnel, municipal workers and vulnerable communities with high risk of exposure. A
                multi-lingual booklet, distributed with the mask, informed users about proper ways to wear it along with

            <p>
                To boost the nation’s COVID-19 vaccination drive, Reliance also launched Mission Vaccine Suraksha in
                April 2021, as a mark of commitment to protect the larger community. Mission Vaccine Suraksha enabled
                free COVID-19 vaccination across the country, covering communities, employees and families across the
                country. Vaccine doses were also provided through outreach efforts to vulnerable communities in
                different locations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reliance collaborated with local authorities and governments through its Mission Vaccine Suraksha
                initiative under the overall ‘We Care’ umbrella. This included free vaccination doses provided to the
                governments of Kerala, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra besides various other national and regional
                organisations to speed up the vaccination drive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mission Vaccine Suraksha aimed to reach every last mile resident, including people with disabilities,
                the elderly, homeless and those in far-flung locations, with free COVID-19 vaccination. This initiative
                continues as vaccination is still the only available protection from coronavirus, thus contributing
                towards the country’s vaccination mission. Reliance Foundation also conducted vaccination drives across
                India such as in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Kerala, among other states. These drives
                supported several vulnerable groups in accessing COVID-19 vaccination.
