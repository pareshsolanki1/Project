                Reliance Foundation has extensively worked with rural communities across India since 2010 to empower
                themselves and their societies in locally feasible ways through a three-pronged approach:

            <p>
                <span>• Enabling women-inclusive development planning and decision-making:</span> Increasing
                participation in
                households, institutions and community decision-making; supporting sustainable agriculture practices and
                climate resilience for food and nutrition security of women and children; and enabling better quality of
                life with improved access to drinking water.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>• Strengthening entrepreneurial and livelihood capabilities for women:</span> Increasing access to
                knowledge,
                livelihood skills, productive assets, markets, finance and technologies; promoting women
                entrepreneurship on diverse livelihood options both farm and non-farm and increasing participation of
                women in various value chains.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>• Enhancing access to basic entitlements for social security:</span> Supporting access to

                greatest challenges.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <span>This inaugural 10-month long India fellowship aims to strengthen the leadership capacity of 50
                    inspirational Indian women leaders</span> who are addressing urgent economic and social issues
                across the key
                areas of Rural Transformation, Education, Sports for Development, and Arts, Culture and Heritage.

            </p>
            <p>
                Women’s inclusion in digital technology is an increasingly important tool for education, financial
                inclusion, entrepreneurship, civic participation and information. The WomenConnect Challenge India was
                launched in 2020 by Reliance Foundation and United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
                WomenConnect Challenge (WCC) India aims to identify and support innovative solutions to empower women in
                India, facilitating their access to and use of digital technology to drive positive health, education
                and livelihood outcomes for themselves and their families.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through Round 1 of this Challenge, Reliance Foundation announced grants for 10 not-for-profit
                organisations between Rs. 75 lakh to 1 crore each for over a period of 12 to 15 months. Programmes
                supported focused on building entrepreneurship skills, relevant digital literacy for low-literate users,
                edutainment-based courseware, mentoring and value-chain linkages and support for women working in
                agriculture. The project includes working with communities and youth. Over 3 lakh (300,000) women and
                girls across 17 states are being reached through various initiatives focused on increasing women’s
                economic empowerment through technology. A short summary of the programmes supported under Round 1 can
                be found here.
            </p>
            <p>
                These projects have reached and created sustainable impact in the lives of over 320,000 women and girls
                directly and indirectly, spread over 19 states of India. Women who were trained through these projects
                have also reported increased awareness of and access to digital tools and services, behavioural changes
                in community around their use of technology, increased livelihood and entrepreneurial opportunities and
                awareness of financial products and Government schemes. Reliance Foundation also released a publication
                in May 2023, that highlights stories of impact from these projects, as well as insights and learnings
                for other interventions focused on bridging the gender digital divide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Building on the momentum from Round 1, <span>RF and USAID launched Round 2 of the WomenConnect Challenge
                    India</span>
                in October 2022 to continue to discover innovative ways to bring women online with the support of their
                families and communities, and create sustainable long-term programming that helps bridge the gender
                digital divide. Under Round 2, <span>RF will support 7 innovative projects</span> that empower women via
                access to
                and the use of digital technology to drive positive development and livelihood outcomes for themselves
                and their families, <span>with grants of up to Rs. 1 crore each, for projects ranging from 12 to 18
                    months.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Key focus areas of the Round 2 projects include building digital literacy skills using applications and
                digital platforms for access to relevant information, promoting entrepreneurship and growing
                microenterprises, and financial inclusion. The projects include working with self-help groups, women
                micro- entrepreneurs, women livestock farmers and in post-harvest fisheries, and women from marginalised
                communities and the unorganised sector.

                On International Women’s Day 2021, Chairperson Smt. Nita Mukesh Ambani launched Her Circle, an
                inclusive, collaborative, diverse, interactive, socially-conscious digital movement for the women of
                India. It is an all-encompassing content, social media and goal fulfilment community that caters to the
                rapidly rising aspirations, ambitions, dreams and competencies of women from all social backgrounds.
                Designed as a one-stop destination for engaging women-related content, it provides women space to share
                their life stories, provide inspiration, hope and resilience to others. As a safe space for their
                growth, Her Circle’s intent is to bridge the gendered digital divide that exists while keeping women
                informed, empowered and engaged.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since its launch, Her Circle has become India’s fastest growing digital platform for women with a total

                We have collaborated with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, MSD for Mothers, Tata Trusts and the

                Established in 1996, our <span>Dhirubhai Ambani Scholarship (DAS)</span> ensures inclusive and equitable
                education
                for meritorious students. The main objective of the Dhirubhai Ambani scholarship programme is to provide
                financial support to the meritorious students so that they can complete their higher education without
                any disturbance. The scholarship unleashes the potential of the youth of India to grow into leaders in
                their respective fields. Cumulatively, 12,776 students have received the scholarship, approximately 50%
                of whom are girls.

                Through our <span>‘Education and Sports for All’</span> initiative, Reliance Foundation promotes the
                need to bring
                together sporting talent and provides them with a platform to excel in sports. Between 2020-2021
                Reliance Foundation supported four NGOs working to enhance education and/or sports for girls. These NGOs

                Reliance Foundation also supports girls in the communities around Reliance’s business locations, to help
                them realise their potential. In Shahdol, Madhya Pradesh, we operate bus services for 400 girls from
                local villages, encouraging parents to send their daughters to school and college, even in remote areas
                where transport services may be sporadic and unreliable.
