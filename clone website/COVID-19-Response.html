                The entire Reliance family joined forces to strengthen and fuel the nation’s fight against COVID-19.
                With a 24x7, multi-pronged approach, Reliance quickly mobilised on-the-ground efforts to ensure the
                nation wins the battle against COVID-19 and worked relentlessly during the global coronavirus pandemic
                to be at the service to the people of India. Reliance leveraged all of its resources – human as well as
                material – to help India overcome the threat posed by the virus.
            </p>
            <p>
                The COVID-19 pandemic, which brought unprecedented health and humanitarian challenges for India and the
                entire world from 2020, has hit people’s health and lives hard. The entire Reliance family stepped
                forward to support the nation in its hour of need right from the very start of the pandemic, scaling up
                as the pandemic intensified.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even as the nation and the world faced the crisis Reliance took various initiatives to support the
                nation on urgent needs ranging from testing facilities, PPE manufacturing facilities, COVID-19 special
                wards for healthcare besides emergency food requirements of the most vulnerable. From healthcare to
                medical oxygen, from livelihood support to vaccination, at every stage the Reliance family has stepped
                forward to support the nation to address the needs of the hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reliance responded to the urgent needs of the nation on a mission mode.
            </p>
            <p>

            <p>
                Providing crucial support to the nation to meet a sudden shortage of medical oxygen for COVID-19
                patients, especially during the second wave, Reliance repurposed its factory in Jamnagar in record time
                to produce liquid medical oxygen. This was ramped up to meet the life-saving needs of 100,000 patients
                on a daily basis, delivered free of cost to various states. The facility contributed to 11% of India’s
                total production of medical grade liquid oxygen. Though Reliance was not a manufacturer of medical-grade
                liquid oxygen, it became India’s largest producer of this life-saving resource from a single location in
                order to stand with the country in its hour of need. Under the personal supervision of Shri. Mukesh D.
                Ambani, Chairman and Managing Director, the manufacturing facility at Jamnagar in Gujarat was repurposed
                to produce over 1,000 MT medical grade liquid oxygen and increase transportation capacities. This
                two-pronged approach helped ensure swift and safe supply to various states and Union Territories across
                India.
            </p>
            <p>
                Medical grade liquid oxygen has to be produced in liquid form at -183°C with almost 99.5% purity, which
                poses extraordinary challenges and risks in production and maximising tonnage. Reliance engineers worked
                tirelessly and through process optimisation and modifications of Cryogenic Air Separation Units, were
                able maximise production of medical grade liquid oxygen in a very short span of time. To ensure swift
                transportation, Reliance engineers made logistical modifications to rail and road transport, such as
                laying parallel lines, using hoses, and loading up liquid tankers through pressure differential, since
                liquid oxygen pumps cannot be installed at short notice. Another crucial need was transportation
                capacity for which Reliance airlifted 32 ISO containers and additionally augmented transportation
                capacity for the country in partnership with the Indian Air Force, Aramco and bp for sourcing and
                transportation. This helped fulfil a critical need in assured availability of medical grade liquid
                oxygen for the treatment of severely ill patients across the country. As part of Mission Oxygen,
                Reliance came together to help save lives, pulling all its facilities together for the nation

            <p>
                Realising that during the lockdown marginalised and under-resourced communities across the country would
                need support with immediate food requirements, Reliance Foundation quickly launched a programme to
                distribute food to the needy. Mission Anna Seva became the largest meal distribution programme by a
                corporate foundation anywhere in the world, supplying vulnerable communities with cooked meals,
                ready-to-eat food packets, food coupons, dry ration kits across 19 states and 4 Union Territories under
                this mission. This was facilitated by the expansive support of the Reliance Retail team across the
                country along with volunteers who supported the packing, preparing and supplying provisions for the
                initiative and a network of 200+ NGO partners who helped deliver relief kits and bulk rations to reach
                those most in need.
            </p>
            <p>
                These partners and volunteers ensured Mission Anna Seva reached the last mile by identifying communities
                and families that need help and by stepping out amongst them, even in these uncertain times, to provide
                help to vulnerable communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, 8.5+ crore meals were delivered to support marginalised communities, daily-wage earners and
                frontline workers across the country. The programme reached frontline workers carrying out essential
                COVID-19 services besides daily wage earners and migrant labourers, slum-dwellers, factory workers, and
                old-age home and orphanage residents.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reliance Foundation also provided bulk rations to community kitchens that were serving meals to migrant
                families, labourers, homeless and other needy people. Reliance Foundation also supported migrant
                labourers returning to their home towns and villages by providing cooked meals and rations to support
                them during these challenging times. Mission Anna Seva was a lifeline for people returning to their
                native places from cities. Volunteers from across Reliance work sites in Mumbai, Silvassa, Vadodara,
                Patalganga, Hazira, Jhajjar, Shahdol, Jamnagar, Dahej, Barabanki, Nagothane, Gadimoga and Hoshiarpur
                distributed meals in their respective locations as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meals were also distributed among truck drivers transporting essential items, who found it difficult to
                access food as restaurants were shut due to the lockdown. Reliance petrol stations in West Bengal,
                Kerala and Odisha also reached out to distribute meals to truck drivers.

                animals. Animal food was provided to partner organisations which look after stray animals. Grain feed
                was provided for birds and fodder kits were also provided for livestock in rural areas. Over one lakh

                To help meet the sudden demand for specialised healthcare facilities during COVID-19, Reliance
                Foundation set up medical, quarantine and intensive care facilities, providing for over 2,000 COVID-19
                hospital beds across different locations in India.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reliance Foundation demonstrated its commitment and capacity to rise up to the situation during the
                response to the COVID-19 crisis setting up the first, COVID-19 dedicated hospital in India in just two
                weeks in March 2020, in collaboration with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporate (BMC).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Sir H.N. Reliance Foundation Hospital and Research Centre (RFH) set up special medical facilities

            </p>
            <p>
                In response to the second wave, Reliance Foundation scaled up its support. This included a dedicated
                COVID-19 care facility at the National Sports Club of India, Worli, Mumbai, managed by the Sir H.N.
                Reliance Foundation Hospital, and Gujarat’s first paediatric COVID-19 hospital at Jamnagar. All
                facilities were set up in record time keeping the urgency of the prevailing situation in mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reliance Foundation’s Mobile Medical Units continued to provide medical assistance to the rural
                communities in the times of COVID-19 and also helped raise awareness about precautionary measures like

                To boost the nation’s COVID-19 vaccination drive, Reliance also launched Mission Vaccine Suraksha in
                April 2021, as a mark of commitment to protect the larger community. Mission Vaccine Suraksha enabled
                free COVID-19 vaccination across the country, covering communities, employees and families across the
                country. Vaccine doses were also provided through outreach efforts to vulnerable communities in
                different locations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reliance collaborated with local authorities and governments through its Mission Vaccine Suraksha
                initiative under the overall ‘We Care’ umbrella. This included free vaccination doses provided to the
                governments of Kerala, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra besides various other national and regional
                organisations to speed up the vaccination drive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mission Vaccine Suraksha aimed to reach every last mile resident, including people with disabilities,
                the elderly, homeless and those in far-flung locations, with free COVID-19 vaccination. This initiative
                continues as vaccination is still the only available protection from coronavirus, thus contributing
                towards the country’s vaccination mission. Reliance Foundation also conducted vaccination drives across
                India such as in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Kerala, among other states. These drives
                supported several vulnerable groups in accessing COVID-19 vaccination.

                During COVID-19 pandemic, Reliance Foundation Information Services connected rural livelihood
                practitioners with government officials and experts (scientists, researchers) to address issues that
                were faced while enrolling for various government schemes, agriculture and allied services inputs.
                Together with various stakeholders the Information Services created awareness, supported employment
                drives to meet temporary paramedical staffing requirements, helped provide medicines and met other
                necessities such as supporting oxygen plants.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the first wave, the emphasis was on ensuring market linkages for rural communities and delivery
                of information, agricultural inputs and basic essentials including nutrition. The focus during the
                second and third wave was on sustained campaign towards protection and enhanced prevention through
                vaccination and adherence to COVID-19 safe behaviour while carrying out usual livelihood activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reliance Foundation also provided specialist help and advice to Gram Panchayat leaders and other rural
                community groups on various schemes for financial support and livelihood opportunities through virtual
                conferences for farmers, fishermen, livestock owners and migrant labourers. These services helped reach
                close to 44+ lakh people in rural India with continued livelihood support.
